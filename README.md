## General Information
Surprise Housing, a US-based company, aims to enter the Australian market by leveraging data analytics to purchase houses below market value and sell them at a profit. The project utilizes a dataset of Australian house sales to build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict house prices accurately. The objective is to identify significant variables influencing house prices and determine the model's predictive performance.

## Conclusions
- Significant variables for predicting house prices: LotArea, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, BsmtFinSF1, TotalBsmtSF, GrLivArea, TotRmsAbvGrd, Street_Pave, RoofMatl_Metal.
- Ridge Regression R2 score (Train): 0.88, R2 score (Test): 0.87.
- Lasso Regression R2 score (Train): 0.88, R2 score (Test): 0.86.

## Technologies Used
- Python - 3.8
- Scikit-learn - 0.24.1
- Pandas - 1.2.2
